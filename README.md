# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections wants an audit performed on the recent local congressional election. The election audit requires information about the candidates' vote totals and the voter turnout throughought the counties. Using the data provided in the **election_results.csv**, I will determine the total number of votes cast, the number of votes in each county, and the number of votes for each candidate. Using these values, I will calculate the percentage of votes each candidate recieved and the percentage of votes cast in each county.
### Software
Python 3.6.1
Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Election Audit Results

* **Total Votes** = 369,711
    Created a for loop to iterate through all the rows, excluding the header row containing the column names, and added up the total number of rows and therefore the total votes cast.
* **Candidates**
    Within the for loop, added the candidate names to a list called candidate_options if they were not already in the list.
